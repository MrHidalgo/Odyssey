            <p class="pp-about__desc">This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes the manner in which Claym Media & Tech Private Limited ., (“Claym”, “Odyssey”, “we,” or “us”) our website at www.odyssey.zone (the “Site”), and our mobile Application, as well as all related websites, networks, applications, and other services provided by us and on which a link to this Policy is displayed (collectively, together with the Site, and the mobile Application our “Service”), gather information from you on the Service, how we use and disclose such information, and the steps we take to protect such information.</p>
            <p class="pp-about__desc">This policy does not apply to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>• personal data you provide on a third-party site or platform, or</li>
              <li>• information that cannot reasonably identify you (anonymous data and aggregate data)</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="pp-about__title">Information we Collect</p>
            <p class="pp-about__title">User-provided Information</p>
            <p class="pp-about__desc">When you use the Service, we may collect information about you, including your name, first name and last name, email address, mailing address, mobile phone number, phone number, your date of birth, geographic area, or preferences, and we may link this information with other information about you. You may provide us with information in various ways on the Service. For example, you provide us with information when you register for an account, request for a demo, your employer registers to use the service on your devices, use the service, send us customer service-related requests, or through cookies.</p>
            <p class="pp-about__title">Cookies and Automatically Collected Information</p>
            <p class="pp-about__desc">When you use the Service, we may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your device. We may use session cookies, preference cookies and security cookies. Please note that if you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from the Service, you may not be able to utilize the features of the Service to their fullest potential.</p>
            <p class="pp-about__desc">We may use third party cookies on our Service as well. For instance, we may use Google Analytics to collect and process certain analytics data. Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic. Google uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of our Service. This data is shared with other Google services. Google may use the collected data to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network. Google provides some additional privacy options described at https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites regarding Google Analytics cookies.</p>
            <p class="pp-about__desc">Similarly, we use Crashlytics, a software development kit for crash reporting, application logging, online review and statistical analysis of application logs.</p>
            <p class="pp-about__desc">We may also automatically record certain information from your device by using various types of technology, including “web beacons.” This automatically collected information may include your IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after you use the Service, the pages or other content you view or otherwise interact with on the Service, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use the Service. We also may use these technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with email messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message. This information is gathered from all users and may be connected with other information about you.</p>
            <p class="pp-about__title">Log files</p>
            <p class="pp-about__desc">Claym follows a standard procedure of using log files. These files log visitors when they visit websites. All hosting companies do this and a part of hosting services analytics. The information collected by log files include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date and time stamp, referring/exit pages, and possibly the number of clicks. These are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable. The purpose of the information is for analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users' movement on the website, and gathering demographic information.</p>
            <p class="pp-about__title">Access to Call Logs And SMS Data</p>
            <p class="pp-about__desc">In order to provide call and SMS-blocking related features, Odyssey applications and services will, from time-to-time access incoming and outgoing call information on mobile devices running said services. This will extend to SMS information, if SMS-blocking features have been enabled.</p>
            <p class="pp-about__title">Third Party Web Beacons and Third-Party Buttons</p>
            <p class="pp-about__desc">We may display third-party content on the Service, including third-party advertising. Third-party content may use cookies, web beacons, or other mechanisms for obtaining data in connection with your viewing of the third-party content on the Service. Additionally, we may implement third party buttons (such as “like” or “share” buttons) that may function as web beacons even when you do not interact with the button. Information collected through third-party web beacons and buttons is collected directly by these third parties, not by Claym. Information collected by a third party in this manner is subject to that third party’s own data collection, use, and disclosure policies.</p>
